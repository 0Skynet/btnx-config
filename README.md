History
----
btnx and btnx-config was originally written by [Olli Salonen](https://launchpad.net/~daou). However he has ceased development of the code and one of the repositories is lost. Afraid the code might be totally lost if it is not hosted somewhere, I acquired his blessing to move the project here and maintain it. (Meaning this isn't a fork.) It is now being maintained (albeit limitedly at the moment), particularly for major bugs.
